# new-user-generator

This is a vanilla JS random user generator using an AJAX call with the fetch API method and a Promise. When you first land on the page, there will be placeholder information. Then, when you click the "Generate A User Profile" button, an AJAX request is send to a 3rd party API to generate a full name, username, email, and a city and state or country for this hypothetical user.

At the end of the webpage, you can see the source code in an iframe sourcing the actually JavaScript file on my server.

Here it is in action: http://user-generator.davidmdugger.com/
